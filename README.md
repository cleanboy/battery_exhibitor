battery_exhibitor
=================

This was created while working for SmarterShows Ltd and therefore belongs to them but was written by myself.

Working version can be found at http://www.thebatteryshow.com/exhibitor_test.html

Long story short the main file you want to be looking at is exhibitor.js

Its a script that filters out the list according to exhibitor, places them all into properly structured Divs and then
also sorts out the alphabetical list at the top by linking appropriate letters that are available. It is fully dynamic
if more exhibitors are added to the list.

Enjoy!
